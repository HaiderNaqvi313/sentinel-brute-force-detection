#  Microsft Sentinel-brute-force-detection (Incidentt Response/Rule Detection Creation)
Microsoft Sentinel rule to detect brute force attacks on Azure VMs â€“ aligned with NIST 800-61 IR lifecycle.


## Brute Force Detection Rule in Microsoft Sentinel

This project demonstrates how to detect brute force attacks on Azure virtual machines using Microsoft Sentinel.

It includes a complete setup:
- KQL detection rule
- Step-by-step UI screenshots
- Incident response report based on NIST 800-61
- Optional automated response guidance


Tools & Framework Used :

- Microsoft Sentinel
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
- NIST SP 800-61 Incident Response Lifecycle


 Project: Brute Force Detection in Microsoft Sentinel
Incident Type: Brute Force Attack on Azure VMs
Framework: NIST SP 800-61 â€“ Incident Response Lifecycle

âœ… Step 1: Preparation
Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) were already deployed on all VMs.

Log collection and monitoring were active.

NSG (Network Security Group) rules existed but needed tightening.

### âœ… Step 2: Detection & Analysis

Brute force attempts were detected from 5 public IP addresses targeting 6 different Azure VMs.

| IP Address         | Device Name               | Action Type   | Failed Attempts |
|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 178.20.129.235     | vmchei                    | LogonFailed   | 52              |
| 134.209.120.69     | dangerclose               | LogonFailed   | 57              |
| 216.225.206.246    | windows-mde-kb            | LogonFailed   | 80              |
| 193.37.69.105      | jh-vm-test-mde            | LogonFailed   | 57              |
| 193.37.69.105      | mde-ron                   | LogonFailed   | 82              |
| 185.243.96.107     | threat-hunt-lab           | LogonFailed   | 54              |

ðŸ”Ž **KQL Query Used:**

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where RemoteIP in ("178.20.129.235", "134.209.120.69", "216.225.206.246", "193.37.69.105", "185.243.96.107")
| where ActionType != "LogonFailed"




_________________________________________________________________________________________________________




âœ… Step 3: Detection Rule Creation in Sentinel
ðŸŽ¯ Rule Logic (KQL):
kql
Copy
Edit
DeviceLogonEvents
| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
| where RemoteIP !startswith "10." and RemoteIP !startswith "192.168." and RemoteIP !startswith "172."
| summarize FailedAttempts = count() by RemoteIP, DeviceName, bin(Timestamp, 1h)
| where FailedAttempts >= 50
ðŸ“Œ Rule Settings:
Type: Scheduled Query Rule

Run every: 5 hours

Look back: 5 hours

Severity: High

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:

Tactic: Credential Access

Technique: Brute Force (T1110)



_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

âœ… Step 4: Containment, Eradication & Recovery
Affected VMs were isolated using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

Full anti-malware scans were run on all machines.

Continued monitoring showed no further malicious activity.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

âœ… Step 5: Post-Incident Activity
NSG rules were updated to block RDP access from the public internet.

Only allowed access from trusted IPs (e.g., analystâ€™s home IP).

Proposed policy to enforce Bastion Host usage for all VM remote access going forward.
